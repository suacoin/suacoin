Intro
---------------------
Suacoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

How it was created?
-------------------

We just forked the Satoshi 0.8.5 bitcoin client, set a new name, a new currency code
(SUA) and started mining the coins (just like bitcoin) from scratch. To bootstrap we
premined the 7000 blocks, so we could test it and published the code online right
after on git. It will grow from here just like any other altcoin.

How many SUA can there be?
--------------------------

21 Million Suacoins.

What is the difference from bitcoin?
------------------------------------

The name, the currency name, small blockchain (when compared to BTC), since we only
started mining in December 2018. Automatic Reset difficulty.

Why use it?
-----------

You have a much greater chance of earning coins (and faster), since the blockchain
is smaller (started only in december 2018). With BTC there is already few years and
many blocks completed, so this means the difficulty and hardware required to mine
is much more expensive. It's compatible with Bitcoin mining SHA-256 equipment and
pool software.

How much is worth one SUA?
--------------------------

The open market (between sellers and buyers) at exchanges around the world will
decided the exchange rate for SUA.
